## Problem Statement
In recent years, the rise of social media, increasing political polarization, economic pressures, and the spread of consumerist culture have contributed to a weakening sense of community among younger generations. This disconnection has led to heightened feelings of loneliness and isolation, both of which are major contributing factors to the growing mental health crisis. In response, there is a pressing need to create meaningful opportunities for youth to reconnect â€” not just socially, but through shared purpose and collective action.
